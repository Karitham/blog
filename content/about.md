# About

I'm Karitham, a passionate contributor to the open-source community with a drive to build and explore.

Go expert, Kubernetes sufferer, and cinema (both live/animation) enjoyer.

I'm constantly tinkering and bringing ideas to life. I'm working towards having a place to share and give back to the community.

A place with real thoughts written by a real human.
