# Kar's thoughts

I'm trying to get better at writing, and I think the best way to do that is to actually write stuff.

By regularly writing down my ideas and posting them here, I hope to write more clearly and organize my thoughts better.

I'll be writing about many topics that interest me, from technology and science to philosophy and personal thoughts.
Each post will be a chance for me to challenge myself, learn something new,
and hopefully give something useful to anyone who reads it.

So, welcome to my blog! I hope you'll join me on this writing journey, and maybe we can learn and grow together as we put our thoughts into words.

The website is written through [zine](https://zine-ssg.io).
I enjoy using cutting edge tech. I use [catpuccin](https://catppuccin.com) for all my systems so the theme is based on the palette.
I've found it fairly difficult to consistenly get good styling, and starting from a great palette helps a lot.
